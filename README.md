# Exploring audio datasets with Streamlit

Using the first fold of the [ESC-50 dataset](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50) as an example dataset, this tool lets you explore your audio dataset.

It offers several visualization techniques, such as waveplots, MFCCs, and spectrograms. A (slightly) more detailed description is available at [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploring-audio-datasets-with-python-498c295f73d9).

See a screenshot below and play around with it live [here](https://share.streamlit.io/phrasenmaeher/audio_exploration/main.py).
